# Tab Manager Extension 
Let's say you have 20 YouTube and 30 Stackoverflow tabs open, it'll become cluttered and you will have to group them. Now if you'll start grouping them manually , then it'll take a lot of you're time.
I also used to face the same issue, hence I made this.

### How to use:
1) Enter the name of the URL of the tabs which are to be grouped and click the Get Tabs button to get the list of the tabs to group.
2) Enter the name of their Group.
3) Just click Group tabs and your work is done, i.e. the tabs are grouped now.

## The extension goes by the name: Tab Manager By Rudransh Aggarwal üßë‚Äçüíª

## Do check it out, you're feedback will make me improve the extension.
